# Cal_hacks Hackathon


A first prototype of our tool that provides employees with a personalized Burnout Scoring. 
This first version of the burnout scoring is built with 5 different features, based on the scientifically proven behaviors associated with early signs of burnout: 

- Demographics: gender and age
- Sentiments: obtained analyzing written conversations with the Google Cloud Natural Language API
- Insomnia: as soon as the person uses his electronic device during sleeping time
- Effectiveness: depending on the number of emails read on a daily basis
- Seasonality: depending on daylight, business cyclicality, main holidays and bonus payments
